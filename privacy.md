_Last updated: 2025-08-15_

## 1. Who we are
Beenbag (“we”, “us”) provides a Discord bot. Contact: **CONTACT_EMAIL**.

## 2. What data we process
- **Discord IDs** (user, guild, channel, message IDs) to operate commands and features.
- **Profile & guild metadata** (e.g., display name, roles) to grant achievements/roles.
- **Gameplay data** (inventory, barn contents, achievements, XP/levels, purchase & sacrifice history).
- **Configuration** (server settings, allowed channels).
- **We do not store message content** except minimal content derived for gameplay triggers (e.g., matching a spawn by name) and logs necessary for abuse prevention.

## 3. Why we process it (legal bases)
- To provide the bot’s features (contract / legitimate interest).
- To keep the service secure and prevent abuse (legitimate interest).
- To comply with legal obligations when required.

## 4. Retention
We retain data while the bot is active in your server and for a reasonable period afterwards for security and restoration. You can request earlier deletion (see “Your rights”).

## 5. Sharing
We do not sell your data. We may use hosting/providers (e.g., database, cloud) to run the bot; they process data on our behalf under appropriate safeguards.

## 6. International transfers
Data may be processed in the UK/EU and/or other countries where our providers operate, with safeguards such as SCCs where required.

## 7. Your rights (GDPR/UK GDPR)
You can request access, correction, deletion, or portability of your data, or object/restrict processing. Contact **CONTACT_EMAIL** with your Discord ID and the server ID.

Server admins can remove the bot at any time to stop further collection.

## 8. Children
Use of Discord requires being at least 13 years old (or the regional minimum). We do not knowingly process data of younger users.

## 9. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data; no system is perfectly secure.

## 10. Changes
We may update this policy. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.
